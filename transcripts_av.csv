/media/NAS/DATASET/1mDFDC/train/id00012/OuYBFCAc6GE/00078/real.mp4,BRINGING HIM INTO THE FOLD A LITTLE BIT MORE I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES THAT THEY COULD GO WITH THE CHARACTERS SO I WOULD LOVE FOR THAT TO BE THE CASE BUT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE

/media/NAS/DATASET/1mDFDC/train/id00012/OuYBFCAc6GE/00076/real.mp4,TO BE POSSIBILITIES FOR STEVE TO COME BACK I THINK IT'LL BE HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO THE CHARACTER I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF THEIR DECISIONS AND ALSO I THINK IF THEY CAN COME UP WITH INTERESTING STORYLINES I KNOW THAT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IF THE CHARACTER THEY FEEL HAS RUN ITS COURSE THEN YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT BUT
